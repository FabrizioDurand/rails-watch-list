git clone git@github.com:FabrizioDurand/rails-watch-list.git

The ouput should start with something like `ruby 3.1.2`

If not, install the right ruby version using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (it could take a while):

```shell
rbenv install 2.5.1
```

### Install dependencies

Using [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler) and [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn):

```shell
bundle && yarn
```

### Initialize the database

rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

rails s && yarn build  --watch
```
